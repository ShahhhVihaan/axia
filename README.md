# Axia

**Axia** is my playground for building clean, control systems for underactuated robots with the help of MuJoCo. The name *Axia* (ἀξία) means **"value" or "cost"** in Greek.

### Installation
1. `sudo apt install cmake build-essential libglfw3-dev`
2. `mkdir build`
3. `cd build`
4. `cmake ..`
5. `make`
